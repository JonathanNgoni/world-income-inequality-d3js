# world-income-inequality-d3js
Pure D3js code to visualize the world income inequality. 


In this project, the aim was to provide a visualization of a subset of World Inequality Database, which is
a database containing the latest information in economic inequality across different countries. Having a
subset of it, we wanted to find a way to visualize it so that to emphasize the most important information
and to answer some of our questions regarding that dataset. To achieve this we used different tools such as
the libraries: d3js, TopoJSON, d3-queue etc. As a result, we could do some interactive visualization which
was able to reflect our perception of the most relevant content. It is mainly composed of a world map and 3
charts, which are updated to give information according to the country which is selected.
